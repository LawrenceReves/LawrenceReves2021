            <h2>Hello</h2>

            <p>I’m Lawrence, a graphic designer based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. I am currently
            in the second year of the Graphic Design program at Red River College.
            My approach when designing is to always be uncomplicated, inclusive, and effective.
            With being immersed in modern design from a young age, I tend to pull inspiration from art, shapes, and colour.</p>

            <p>I’m primarily interested in identity and branding, as well as designing for print and web.
              I also enjoy typography and concept development. </p>

            <p>Email me, I’d love to work together!</br><b>l_reves@hotmail.com</b></p>

        <div class="project-text">
          <h3 class="project-header">They.</h3>
          <p class="subhead">Editorial + Web</p>

          <p class="body-text">They. is a print and web project that was built around the
            topic of gender identity and gender expression. Historically, the terms “sex”
            and “gender” have been used interchangeably, but their uses are becoming increasingly
            distinct, and it is becoming more and more important in our society to understand and
            accept the differences between the two. That is why I created a space both physically
            and digitally that could be curated for young adults — in a way they could relate to
            the design style while still being educated on the topics. Vibrant colours contrasted
            with black and white illustrations allow for a playful nature while not veering too
            far off from the importance of the written content. Typography choices along with
            negative white space introduces an editorial feel to appeal to the more mature
            audience that may be taking in the information for themselves or for their children.
            They. stands for everything I believe in when it comes to inclusivity.</p>
