            <h2>Hello</h2>

            <p>I’m Lawrence, a graphic designer based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. I am currently
            in the second year of the Graphic Design program at Red River College.
            My approach when designing is to always be uncomplicated, inclusive, and effective.
            With being immersed in modern design from a young age, I tend to pull inspiration from art, shapes, and colour.</p>

            <p>I’m primarily interested in identity and branding, as well as designing for print and web.
              I also enjoy typography and concept development. </p>

            <p>Email me, I’d love to work together!</br><b>l_reves@hotmail.com</b></p>

          <p class="body-text">I was Lucky enough to design the Manitoba
            Studio Fund 2021 website during my second work placement this year
            with the amazing people at Manoverboard. I also got to collaborate with a
            DMD student who's responsibilty was to code the website. They allowed me to really
            make the project my own while still adhering to brand guidelines.
            My primary objective for this website design was to create something
            that at its core felt warm, colourful, and unique — a few things in a
            list of what I think about when I think of black, indigenous, and people
            of colour. Designating each section of the site a neutral/’flesh-like’ tone
            from the brand guide was the foremost way in which I chose to achieve that.
            Photos were treated monochromatically to allow the page colour to remain a
            unified focal point. Fivo Sans Modern — a strong sans serif with personality
            for headers is accompanied by Pragmatica from the brand guide for optimal readability.
            For movement/interactivity, I wanted to add a subtle layer of dynamics to the site while not
            distracting from the content. Overall, I felt incredibly lucky to be a part of this
            project, and I thank the GDC, and all the of the scholarship founds + founders for
            helping BIPOC designers by forming The Manitoba Studio Fund.</p>
